1st -   Introduce ourselves 

2nd -   Describe our model with code snippets

3rd -   Explain how our original goal of finding optimal traces 
        only was interesting if we had nontrivial starting board
        configurations

4th -   Explain how we tried to investigate how to characterize 
        nontrivial board configurations and nontrivial traces

5th -   We tried to constrain nontrivial traces by not allowing 
        for repeated board states, but this led us to realize that, 
        still, of these constrained traces not all moves were individually 
        optimal.

6th -   We tried to reason if there was a way to characterize optimal
        moves (TODO - victor determine properties that we "tried" plus 
        the instances that show a contradiction). We conjecture that 
        this is impossible, as it seems that you only can verify 
        if a move is optimal if you have the optimal solution, making it 
        appear that this problem of determining "move optimality" is 
        NP-complete. If such an algorithm did exist which you could in 
        polynomial-time determine the optimality of a move, then one could
        construct a greedy algorithm in polynomial-time that determines 
        optimal traces by making optimal-move choices at each state, instead
        of exhaustively testing all possible moves.
